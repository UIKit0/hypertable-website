							<dd>Zvents, the local search engine for things to do, is the employer of all of the initial authors and contributors to Hypertable. Zvents has sponsored the Hypertable project for its own local search and local ad targeting solutions, and has chosen to release it under an open-source license to participate in the many benefits of the open-source community.</dd>

						<dt><a name="baidu" class="external" href="http://www.baidu.com/" target="_blank" >Baidu</a></dt>
							<dd>Baidu (Nasdaq: BIDU), the leading internet search services provider in China has decided to become an official sponsor by adopting Hypertable across the company and committing a team of engineers and numerous servers to use and improve Hypertable. Baidu's decision came after months of evaluting Hypertable and other alternative solutions. We believe that Baidu's commitment further validates the quality and progress of the project and bodes well for the long term viability of Hypertable.
